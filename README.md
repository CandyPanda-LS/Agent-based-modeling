# Agent-based-modeling-
Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational modelling technique used in many domains to simulate complex systems made up of autonomous agents, commonly represented as individuals, and their interactions with their surroundings. This study uses ABM and the AnyLogic simulation platform to analyse student behaviour and space-related difficulties at the University of Colombo's Faculty of Science.

The primary goal of this study is to quantify the scarcity of locations available for students to spend their free time. The research intends to detect peak hours of space constraint and measure the success of an upcoming building construction project in addressing these difficulties by modelling the movements and preferences of individual students inside the AnyLogic framework.

Subsequently, the data that was gathered was thoroughly analysed to provide significant insights on optimising space utilisation within the Faculty of Science. The AnyLogic simulation platform enables a complete investigation of agent behaviours and preferences, allowing for a thorough knowledge of present spatial restrictions and their impact on student experiences.

The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the overall learning environment by resolving space constraints and improving the quality of student life, with AnyLogic serving as a strong simulation and analytic tool.
